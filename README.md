# Get Texture from a Terrain or Renderer

Using this tutorial repository and [associated video](https://youtu.be/YX8E1AE3BYs) you will learn how to get the Albedo texture from any Renderer using any Shader AND how to get the active textures on a Unity terrain at any given point.

You'll learn by the example of creating a simple footstep system that uses a Raycast down from a Character Controller and plays an AudioClip based on the hit texture of either the Renderer or Terrain. You'll also learn how to blend the AudioClips together when there is more than 1 active texture on the Terrain (blended with splatmaps).
